name: Release Please (release-plz)

# This workflow uses release-plz to manage changelogs and releases.
#
# Workflow:
# 1. Trigger manually: Opens a PR with changelog updates and version bumps
# 2. Review and merge the release PR
# 3. Tags created automatically when release PR merges (path filter ensures this)
# 4. Tags trigger existing goreleaser workflows for binary builds
#
# The path filter ensures this only runs when Cargo.toml files change,
# which only happens when a release PR (that you approved) is merged.
# Regular code PRs do NOT trigger this workflow.
